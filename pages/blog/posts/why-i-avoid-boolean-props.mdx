# Why I avoid boolean props

When creating components that are meant to be used by people other than you, 
it's vital to consider how self-explanatory your component's API is. By that,
I mean it's props.

Consider the following example:

```jsx
<Card small />
```

The Card component might be implemented as follows:

```jsx
function Card(props) {
  return (
    <section style={{width: props.small ? '40px' : '80px'}}>
      {props.children}
    </section>
  )
}

Card.propTypes = {
  small: PropTypes.bool
}
```

And that works just fine! Except that with just the _small_ word, we don't quite
know what we made smaller. When rapidly developing a component, we often use short
words that make sense for us *at that moment* but they tend to get confusing.

Before we get to a better name for that prop, let's take a look at another problem.

What happens if we now have 3 different Card sizes? Small, medium and large. Well,
the implementation certainly needs to be changed. We need to get rid of the ternary
operator and put that logic somewhere else.

```jsx
function getWidth({small, medium, large}) {
  let widthSize = '40px';

  if (medium) {
    widthSize = '60px';
  }

  if (large) {
    widthSize = '80px';
  }

  return widthSize;
}

function Card(props) {
  return (
    <section style={{width: getWidth(props)}}>
      {props.children}
    </section>
  )
}

Card.propTypes = {
  small: PropTypes.bool,
  medium: PropTypes.bool,
  large: PropTypes.bool
}
```

That works too! Now we can use our component and it's 3 different sizes:

```jsx
<Card small />
<Card medium />
<Card large />
```

We might say that our work here is done, but is it? Look carefully and think from
the user (a developer) point of view. How self-explanatory are these props? Do you
remember our one prop naming problem? Well, now we have three.

What happens if I omit all of them? What happens if I use two of them at the same time?

```jsx
<Card />
<Card small large />
<Card large medium />
```

If our component cannot be _small_, _medium_ and _large_ at the same time, then why
do we allow it to be consumed as if it can? These props all refer to one style in our
component, a style that cannot receive multiple values. Let's make things more clear
to the user and change our API.

```jsx
const widthSize = {
  small: '40px',
  medium: '60px',
  large: '80px'
}

function Card(props) {
  return (
    <section style={{width: widthSize[props.widthSize]}}>
      {props.children}
    </section>
  )
}

Card.propTypes = {
  widthSize: PropTypes.oneOf(['small', 'medium', 'large'])
}
```

Now, our component is consumed like this:

```jsx
<Card widthSize="medium" />
```

Is it more work? Certainly. Remember though that we write code for humans to read
and your fellow developer will thank you when he does not need to take a look at
your implementation to find out what will happen.

In summary, make your component's API clear to the user consuming it. Prefer
well-named props with a clear intent.

Do this:

```jsx
<Button theme="primary" />
```

Instead of this:

```jsx
<Button primary />
```
