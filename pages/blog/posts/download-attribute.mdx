# The download attribute

Many of us are familiar with the download attribute in an anchor tag, such as:

```
<a href="https://bini.dev/static/bini.jpeg" download="bini_face.jpg" >download my face</a>
```

What it does is pretty straight forward: it prompts the user to download the file instead of trying to navigate there.

Today, while creating a anchor to download a static file from a cdn, I learned that this attribute does not work with different origins.

Say, for instance, if you click this link, it will not work. The code for the link is this:

```
<a href="https://mdn.com/file.exe" download="file.exe">link</a>
```
