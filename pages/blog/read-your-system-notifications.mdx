# Read your system's notifications

Today, after over a month of it being turned off, I've turned my Surface Laptop 3 on. I rarely
use it nowdays because my work is done on a company Macbook.

Anyway, after installing some updates, I checked this blog's repository. Right after opening Visual Studio Code,
I get a nice notification that tells me I am opening this project folder from within Ubuntu (WSL2) but the folder
is in the Windows File System. At first, I ignore it and proceed to updating the packages in the blog project.

Right before running a local build command to check if things are ok, I decide to time the execution:

```bash
time npm run build
npm run build  22.81s user 9.03s system 79% cpu 40.163 total
```

Then, I proceed to adding and pushing the changes to the repository so I can get a fresh clone from within the
Ubuntu File System. There, after a quick `npm ci` I run

```bash
time npm run build
npm run build  32.07s user 2.00s system 334% cpu 10.177 total
```

The difference is HUGE, from 40.163 seconds to 10.177 seconds!
